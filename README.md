# ISE-364-ML-Project

This project explores the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017–2018** dataset from the CDC to analyze how demographic factors, socioeconomic indicators, and nutritional intake relate to key health outcomes. The project applies data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models to uncover meaningful trends within the U.S. population.
